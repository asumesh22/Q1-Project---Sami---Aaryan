Background and Project Goal

In New York City, a police report, also known as an MV104-AN, is required to be filled out for car collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage. As cities like New York City grow and traffic conditions become more complex, it is essential to have a comprehensive view of the incidents that occur on roads and identify trends and factors that may lead to dangerous outcomes.

Classifying the lethality of car crashes based on various factors such as weather and time of day can allow the city of New York to use preventive measures to stop accidents.

Our project goal will be to classify car crashes in New York City. People can use our model and using the information that the model uses, they can predict whether or not the location is prone to car accidents. People can use this in urban planning, where they can see where to invest money in improving both pedestrian and driver safety.
